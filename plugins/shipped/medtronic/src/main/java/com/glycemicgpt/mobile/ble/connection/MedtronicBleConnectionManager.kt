/*
 * Phone-as-peripheral BLE connection manager for the Medtronic MiniMed 700-series read-only driver.
 *
 * GlycemicGPT code (GPL-3.0). This is the inverted-topology connection core that has no Tandem
 * equivalent to clone: the phone advertises as a "Mobile …" peripheral and the pump connects to it
 * as the central (medtronic-ble-reverse-engineering.md Sec. 3). It owns the connection lifecycle,
 * drives the SAKE handshake (Sec. 4) to a live encrypted session, and auto-reconnects to an
 * already-paired pump. The Android BLE plumbing it sits on top of is modelled on OpenMinimed's
 * JavaPumpConnector (GPL-3.0, used with permission).
 *
 * Scope (Milestone B2): connection + authentication + reconnect only. The data readers (CGM/IOB/
 * history) and the MedtronicDevicePlugin / Hilt registration that consume this manager land in
 * Milestone C. Over-the-air validation against a real pump rides with 48.A2 / Milestone F -- nothing
 * here is claimed live-verified.
