 * Peripheral-mode BLE transport seam for the Medtronic MiniMed 700-series read-only driver.

 * reuse. This interface abstracts the Android BluetoothLeAdvertiser + BluetoothGattServer plumbing
 * (implemented by AndroidMedtronicPeripheral, modelled on OpenMinimed's JavaPumpConnector
 * BlePeripheralDevice, GPL-3.0, used with permission) so the connection lifecycle in
 * MedtronicBleConnectionManager can be driven and unit-tested without the Android BLE stack.
